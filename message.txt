Fix user registration bug, implement delete functions, and resolve duplicate post request issue

- Fix bug in user registration by including environment variable configuration in the auth controller:
  - require('dotenv').config();
  - const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

- Implement delete functions for user, task, and project controller

- Include pre-hooks in user, project, and task models to handle cascading deletions:

- Fix bug where both AdminDash and CreateProject components were sending duplicate post requests:
- Moved the full post request logic to the CreateProject component to avoid redundancy and ensure single request handling.
